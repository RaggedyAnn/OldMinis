Tree Generator


Instructions:

You press any key to redraw the sketch and generate a new unique tree


My inspiration for this generator was this example: "P_2_2_4_01" from website: http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/code

I really wanted do something like the branching, but by looking at the code I thought it looked
unncecesarily complicated, if I just wanted to make branching, so I made this as a simpler alternative.


It is a simple contruction, of simple lines, for which the only rules are that they either split in two,
or continue. The same code is repeated for the trunk as for the branches by calling the same function
inside the function(recursion), but with a slight variation with the help of the random function. This 
generates a new unique tree every time you start the program or press a key.
