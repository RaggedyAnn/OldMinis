A Calming Throbber \n
A throbber that strives to be more calming than the usual throbber. When spending minutes of your life 
that feels like hours looking at throbbers that in a fast pace keeps going round and round, it can be 
hard not to lose patience. As an attempt to make it easier to keep calm in a situation that feels like an 
endless wait, I made this slow throbber consisting of a globe on which light gets stronger and weaker. \n
