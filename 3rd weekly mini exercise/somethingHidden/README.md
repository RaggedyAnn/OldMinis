Something Hidden

This code is playing on the old saying "don't judge a book by it's cover". At first it might just look like 
a simple box, slowly turning in empty space, but when you see what's inside you reveal that there is 
something more to it. Other little boxes turning in their own empty space inside the box. It makes you 
wonder if the big box is just floating in it's own empty space in a even bigger box(which, evident in the 
code, it actually is), that you just (barely) can't see. How much more is there that we can't see with our 
eyes?
