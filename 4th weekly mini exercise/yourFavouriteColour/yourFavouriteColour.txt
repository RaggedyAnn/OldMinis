and white is in that way a simple and clean colour. What a good choice you made.

You chose mint green. It might not be the first choice for everybody, but it is a colour with freshness and life. Good choice.

You chose blue. Who says you are not creative? Even the sky has many nuances of blue. The possibilities are unlimited for what you can 
do with the deep and calming colour of blue. What a good choice you made.

You chose pink. Why should colour and sexuality have anything to do with each other? and why would the last comment even be a 
discouragement? That does not even make sense. Pink is a bright and happy colour. What a nice choice.

You chose black. Maybe you chose this because it is a basic and simple colour that goes with everything, or maybe it is an actual 
reflection of your soul. Regardless it does not make you more or less cheery to have chosen this colour. What a good choice.
