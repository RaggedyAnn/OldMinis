4th weekly mini exercise



What is your favourite colour?

The program asks you a question, but it gives you a very little amount of possibilities to choose from. 


Let's say you choose one anyway. Now the program makes a rude comment about your choice. Then you might 
try another colour, but the same happens, another rude comment.


At some point you insist on one colour and confirm that this is the colour you want to choose. Now the 
program gives you positive feedback on the choice you made. 
What does this mean?


You kept getting negative feedback, but if you go with the colour YOU want, you will get credit for
sticking to your own choice and not letting others opinion change your mind without having a valid reason.


I made this as a sort of representation of the impression you easily can get of how it is to communicate 
on the internet, especially on forums where people hide behind usernames or the alike, and where it becomes 
near impossible to express even an insignificant opinion, without anybody throwing hate at you, or 
deliberately making a 'shitstorm'. But don't let hate get to you, because you are entitled to have an 
opinion, so stick to it. It will probably benefit you in the long run.


NB! Yes, this program has no limits for pressing the keys, so if you keysmash the keyboard there will
happened some mistakes, but it is always possible to reset by clicking the mouse ;) 


IMPORTANT: The so called "rude comments" in this program is in no way similar to my own personal opinions, 
just making sure that's clear.
