Bouncy Balls


I chose to make the inizial postion and size for all the balls fixed, so the difference in the "gravity" and
"weight" of the balls, and how to manipulate their patterns becomes more clear.

I try throughout the code to define what physical phenomna each variable is the equivalent to. fx. "gravity",
"weight" and "acceleration".
